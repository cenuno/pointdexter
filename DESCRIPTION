Description: Labels longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates located inside a polygon.
    For a singular polygon, the label is a logical vector of TRUE and FALSE values. For multiple polygons, the label is a character vector based on the names of each polygon. 
    The package is designed to work with both sf and SpatialPolygonsDataFrame objects.
